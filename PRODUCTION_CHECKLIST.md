### 5. **Input Validation** âœ…
- [x] Created comprehensive validation utility (`src/utils/validation.ts`)
- [x] Added sanitization functions for XSS prevention
- [x] Integrated validation into contact forms
- [x] Added real-time validation feedback

### 6. **Error Monitoring** âœ…
- [x] Integrated Sentry for production error tracking

- [x] Added environment configuration for Sentry DSN

### 7. **Testing** âœ…
- [x] Added unit tests for validation utilities
- [x] Added integration tests for Supabase service
- [x] Added component tests for ContactForm

## ðŸš§ Required Before Production

### 1. **Environment Setup**
- [ ] Create `.env.local` file with actual credentials
- [ ] Add all environment variables to Netlify dashboard:
  ```
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
  REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS
  VITE_SENTRY_DSN
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
  TWILIO_API_KEY
  TWILIO_API_SECRET
  REACT_APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  ```

### 2. **Sentry Setup**
- [ ] Create Sentry account and project
- [ ] Get Sentry DSN and add to environment variables
- [ ] Test error reporting in staging environment

### 3. **Final Security Audit**
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to fix vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review all API endpoints for security
- [ ] Test rate limiting in production environment
- [ ] Verify CSP headers don't break functionality

### 4. **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Test app performance with lighthouse
- [ ] Optimize bundle size if needed
- [ ] Test on various devices and connections

### 5. **Database**
- [ ] Backup database before deployment
- [ ] Verify all migrations are applied
- [ ] Test RLS policies thoroughly

### 6. **Monitoring**
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (e.g., Pingdom, UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Configure alerts for errors in Sentry
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check for TypeScript errors
   npm run typecheck
   
   # Run linter
   npm run lint
   
   # Build locally to verify
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Add all environment variables
   - Verify build settings
   - Test deployment with branch deploy first

3. **Post-deployment**
   - Verify all features work in production
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Monitor Sentry for any issues
   - Test payment flow end-to-end
   - Verify email functionality

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth with RLS policies
   - Session management
   - Admin access controlled via environment variables

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input sanitization on all forms
   - XSS prevention
   - SQL injection protection (via Supabase)

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting on all endpoints
   - CORS properly configured
   - Authentication required for sensitive operations

4. **Error Handling**
   - No sensitive data in error messages
   - Proper error boundaries
   - Centralized error logging

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

Once all items in "Required Before Production" are completed, the application will be secure and ready for production deployment. The critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed, and the app now follows security best practices.
