## Risk Assessment

### If No Immediate Action
- **Relationship will terminate**
- **$85,000 deal lost**
- **Reputation damage** in tight dental community
- **Legal action possible** over unfulfilled promises

### Success Metrics
- Book 1 implant consultation within 7 days
- Capture and respond to 100% of web leads
- Positive feedback from Cindi on progress
- Payment discussion only after proven ROI

---

## Key Insight
The practice doesn't need revolutionary AI - they need to stop losing $180,000 in consultations. Every day without a working lead capture system costs them potential implant cases. Jason must shift from selling the future to fixing today's revenue leaks.

**Bottom Line:** Deliver immediate value or lose the account. Period.
