Key insight: TMJ site is their most successful digital asset but they want to promote implants. Solution proposed: Consolidate all properties to gregpedromd.com with automated lead capture.',

    'CRITICAL BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE:
    
1. CURRENT DIGITAL ASSETS:
   - 10+ domains in GoDaddy
   - 7 websites, only 3 active (TMJ, Implant, About Face Dental Spa)
   - About Face Dental Spa on WordPress (3-5 years old, got hacked, Russian bot spam)
   - TMJ site: Most successful - 20,000+ visitors, generating last 7 patients
   - Google Business Profile: 150+ reviews, 4.8 stars
   - No unified analytics across properties

2. REVENUE INSIGHTS:
   - Yomi implant cases: $30,000 each ("all we need is one stinking implant case to cover expenses")
   - 6 implant consultations last week - NONE booked (critical failure point)
   - TMJ driving most traffic but lower revenue per patient
   
3. OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES:
   - Cindi changing Google Business Profile URL frequently (confusion)
   - Jackie has opinions causing conflict on direction
   - WordPress site hacked, receiving hundreds of Russian bot submissions
   - No tracking of leads, conversions, or patient journey
   - Staff confusion on which site to direct patients to

4. TECHNICAL BLOCKERS:
   - Jackie granted WordPress admin access but cannot log in
   - No Google Analytics on most sites
   - GoDaddy analytics exist but limited
   - No lead capture automation
   - No unified patient communication system

5. KEY DECISIONS MADE:
   - Agreed to consolidate all properties to gregpedromd.com
   - Focus on three pillars: Yomi/Implants, TMJ, Aesthetics
   - Implement automated lead capture and follow-up
   - Redirect all domains to central hub
   - Jason to take over WordPress access

6. LINGUISTIC PATTERNS:
   - Cindi uses "you know" frequently (uncertainty/seeking validation)
   - Repeated emphasis on confusion ("all over the place")
   - Financial anxiety evident ("cover our expenses")
   - Trust in Jason''s expertise ("you know better")
   - Urgency in voice about missed opportunities',
